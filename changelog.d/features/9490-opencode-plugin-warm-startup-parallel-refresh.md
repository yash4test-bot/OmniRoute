- feat(opencode-plugin): warm catalog startup from disk snapshot + parallel refresh (#9490)

  The config-shim hook now reads the last disk snapshot before fetching, so the provider registers immediately with the last-known-good catalog (~1-2s vs ~30s on a warm gateway). All six fetchers run concurrently via Promise.allSettled instead of sequentially. A failed refresh keeps the snapshot (no overwrite). An in-flight guard prevents concurrent refreshes for the same cache key. The features.diskCache: false opt-out disables the warm read entirely.
